# Hello
My name is Daniel Steinbrueck. I'm 43 years old.

For the last 5 years I was a bus driver. The job was really hard and the pay was not the best. I decided to do a year abroad in the UK in 2019. There I could get more insight into IT. After returning to Germany in 2021, I decided to go deeper into IT. Through neuefische I got the chance to get into programming with JavaScript.

Please do not expect too much. However, I am highly motivated to work in web development one day.


# Now.
its time for a big change in my life. I will learn coding.

This skills are on my todo list:
- html
- css
- javascript
